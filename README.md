# :robot: Assignment Title 

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

The goal of this lab assignment is for us to practice using classes one more time in this unit.  For this one, we will create our own time class (this one will be `Time` with a capital `T`). 🚀

## 📝 Next steps

1. Clone this repository so you have access to the incomplete `Time.py` module.
2. Fix the code so that it works.
3. Create an `obeservations.txt` file that explains how the code was incomplete and how you fixed it.
4. Add, committ and push the repo with the corrected python script (You do not need to create a new script, just fix this one).
